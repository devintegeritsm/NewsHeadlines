This is a news app - the front-end part of project, which includes app.py and template/index.html
Basic overview:
The main page displays a date card with number of articles found in supabase for that date.
If no articles found no date card will be shown.
On a date card there is a button "Show Articles" which shows article headlines available and links to read and listen (if audio available)
Please read all needed files to understand project properly before start doing anything.
